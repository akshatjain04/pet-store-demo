# CVE-2022-25857
# The package org.yaml:snakeyaml from 0 and before 1.31 are vulnerable to Denial of 
# Service (DoS) due missing to nested depth limitation for collections.
#
# org.yaml/snakeyaml is an indirect dependency we get from spring boot. A 
# spring boot maintainer stated that "Most Sping Boot applications only need 
# SnakeYaml to parse their own application.yml configuration. I don't
# think we can consider this content as untrusted input." I take this to mean
# we're likely not vulnerable to this issue. It should be fixed in Spring Boot
# 2.7.4, which as of 9/15 is not yet released. Snyk will notify us when a fix
# is available. At that time, we should remove this entry from the .trivyignore.

# CVE-2021-23840
# Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow 
# the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the
# maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return
# value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length
# value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
# OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions
# should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by
# this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public
# updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other
# users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i).
# Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

CVE-2021-23840

# CVE-2021-23840
# The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a
# unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509
# certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while
# parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously
# constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash
# leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function
# X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so
# applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use
# it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL
# versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should
# upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this
# issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates.
# Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should
# upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y
# (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).
